##Boilerplate app for Electron with Redux/React

- electron-compile for ES6/ES7 via babel
- BrowserSync for livereload
- structure for redux/react app
- scripts for building cross-platform releases

####Commands
- `npm run serve` - Start electron app in development
- `npm run pack` - Create a package for distribution. Will name the package based on package.json name property. **Note:** Move the package out of `/dist` to run (see [Issue #24](https://github.com/jschr/electron-react-redux-boilerplate/issues/2))
